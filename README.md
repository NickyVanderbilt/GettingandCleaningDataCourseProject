Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with and clean a data set. 

DATASET

The data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

FILES

1. CodeBook.md describes all the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.
2. run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course project's instruction:
    1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set;
    2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement;
    3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set;
    4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names;
    5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each 
       activity and each subject.
 3. Project_Data.txt is the tidy data set created with write.table().      
       
PEER-REVIEWED CRITERIA

1. The submitted data set is tidy;
2. The Github repo contains the required scripts;
3. GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables  and summaries calculated, along with unites, and any other relevant information;
4. The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable;
5. The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.
